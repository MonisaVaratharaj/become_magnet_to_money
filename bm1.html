 <h1>Become A Magnet To Money - Bob Proctor with Michele Blood: Part 1</h1>

        <p><strong>This book is not about recommending investment strategies like stocks, mutual funds, or investment plans.</strong> If that’s the content you’re looking for, feel free to exit this page.</p>

        <p>This book helps you prosper with an increase of money, power, and Light. Many greatest minds and souls have been teaching these truths about the power of our thoughts,  from Augustus, The Buddha, Jesus - the Christ, and all of the great authors of the past 100 years.All these great minds said basically the same thing in different ways, <span class="important"><b> “Thoughts are Things, As Above So Below, With Your Thoughts You Create The World, Only Thinking Makes It So, It Is Your Faith,” </b> (<em> keep reading even if you don't understand, you figure out something at the end, don't quit - if you don't understand the first part, try to read the second part " discovering your ikigai "</em> )</span>.</p>

        <h2>Earning Money is Not Taught in Our Schools</h2>
        <p>Earning money is not taught in our school systems anywhere in the world. Nearly only 3-4% of our population who do understand how to attract wealth and pass their prosperity consciousness from one generation to the next. The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.</p>

        <p>To properly understand how you can magnetize yourself to money, first – you must have an open mind, second – you must remain objective, third – you must understand that the universe operates in an exact way which many people refer to as natural law. I prefer to refer to these laws as <strong>Divine Laws.</strong></p>

        <p>Nothing happens by accident. You are not reading this information by accident; you are ready to learn and accept these great Universal Divine Laws. Yes, you are not reading this by accident. The universe has chosen you; you are blessed to read this. Yes, this may sound crazy, but I will explain this in detail in my upcoming blogs.</p>

        <h2>One of the Basic Laws</h2>
        <p>“Everything is moving. Absolutely nothing rests.” You are either moving ahead in life, or you are going backwards. Grow or die. Create or disintegrate. You are becoming richer or poorer.</p>

        <h2>The Law of Attraction</h2>
        <p>There’s another important law which is referred to in many different ways: Karmic law, Sowing and Reaping, Law of Attraction, Cause and Effect, Action/Reaction.</p>

        <p>The prosperous person will be thinking prosperous thoughts and attracting more of the same. While the poor person will be thinking of lack and limitation and, by law, will attract more of the same. <span class="important">Abundance is something we magnetize ourselves to.<b> Business associates, opportunities, sales, money, love, friends, everything we want will come into our life "by law not luck."</span></b> You are either attracting or repelling good. It is your own consciousness that ultimately determines your results.</p>

        <p>Napoleon Hill’s book, <b> <em>“Think and Grow Rich”</em>,</b> is considered one of the most complete works ever compiled on the accumulation of wealth. In the publisher’s preface of the book, it is stated that <span class="important">“Think and Grow Rich” conveys the experience of more than 500 individuals of great wealth , all who began from scratch with nothing. (<em> keep reading even if you don't understand, you figure out something at the end, don't quit </em>)</span></p>

        <h2>Prosperity Consciousness</h2>
        <p>Give serious thought to what I’m about to say. <span class="important">The paper you fold and place in your purse is not money.</span> It is paper with ink on it. It represents money, but it is not money.</p>

        <p><span class="important"><b> Money is an idea.</b></span> (You’ve already read this line in one of my blogs. Don’t you remember? Go and check <b> “RICH DAD POOR DAD” Chapter 3 </b> posted on my Instagram page.) Your earning of money has nothing to do with paper or plastic (credit cards). If you want to solve a problem, you must first attack the cause of the problem. The cause of poverty is poverty consciousness. <span class="important">Poverty consciousness causes a person to see, hear, think, smell, and feel lack and limitation.</span></p>
        <h1>Find Your Ikigai - Discover Your Passion</h1>

        <p>Do you know people like Sachin Tendulkar and A. R. Rahman? They are the people who do every day what they love. Sachin loves playing cricket, and it's his Ikigai, his passion. He could play for 24 hours a day because he loves doing that. You know A. R. Rahman (A. R. Rahman is an Oscar award winner. He won two Academy Awards (Oscars) at the 81st Academy Awards in 2009). He loves composing music and singing songs. In fact, Rahman once mentioned in an audio release that he had over 40 films in his hands at one time to compose music for, which is truly remarkable. This is something so amazing, right?</p>

        <p>And the common thing is that these people are making a lot of money. They are making crores. How?</p>

        <h2>What Makes Them Different from us?</h2>
        <p>Because they do what they love to do. Every day, it brings new energy. Every day, they are doing the things they love, and their passion gets converted into money. This is the fact: everyone has unique skill sets and knowledge. Yes, everyone has their passion. Everyone has something unique. My passion is reading books. My love for books never dies. Specifically, I am a lover of self-help books because they help transform my life. Every day, I wake up with the love for reading books. I feel so happy when I read books. I love doing that. Even if I had a chance to read for 24 hours a day, I would do it. That's my Ikigai; that's my passion.</p>

        <p>Similarly, you too have a passion. Everyone has a passion. But how do you identify that? How do you discover it? (It’s only the process of discovering because you already have it… You have your unique talents; you already possess a passion.)</p>

        <p>Once you do every day what you love, the money follows. That's the secret.</p>

        <h2>Discover Your Ikigai</h2>
        <p>Here, I will help you discover your Ikigai. In my next blog, I will suggest a simple game on how to convert your Ikigai into an income source.</p>

        <h3>Answer the following questions truthfully to yourself:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Do you really like your current job?</li>
            <li>Are you getting positive energy and spirit when you do your job?</li>
            <li>Are you really loving your job? (Loving means you're ready to do your job even for a whole single day - 24 hours)</li>
            <li>What would you do if money was not your consideration?</li>
            <li>What do you love to do the most?</li>
            <li>What do you love doing in your free time?</li>
            <li>What do you love to talk about the most?</li>
            <li>What would you do if there was no need to earn money for the rest of your life?</li>
            <li>What would you do if there were no financial problems or family problems?</li>
            <li>What would you do if there were no limitations, no barriers, no restrictions? You are completely free to do whatever you want. Then, what would be your choice?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whether you play cricket, tennis, read books, watch movies, edit photographs and videos, sing songs, or dance… whatever it is, that’s your Ikigai. Yes, even watching movies can be your Ikigai.</p>

        <p>Answer all these questions honestly and find your Ikigai. In my next blog, I will guide you on how to convert your Ikigai into a passive income source through a simple game. Be ready with your Ikigai, a pen, and a paper. <br><br>Yes, please be ready. We are going to build a passive income source for you. (Passive income—once you spend time and effort initially setting up your income source, it will give you money forever—until your death. This passive (residual) income doesn’t require your presence once it has been set. I hope you understand. Still, if you have doubts, go and read <b>"RICH DAD POOR DAD " blog posted in insta, </b>where I clearly explain the difference between active and passive income.)</p>
